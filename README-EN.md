# Design Pattern in Unity3D

[中文](README.md)

This repository is a collection of Design Patterns in Unity,written in C#.

Design patterns are great.Many design patterns are subtle just by looking at them,but for some people (at least me as a beginner), the biggest problem is not knowing **why and when to use them**.

So **I try to explain design patterns in a new form**:

For each design pattern, I will first ask a question: If you throw away all the design patterns, how would you achieve a certain function?

Then I will give the bad code and the good code using the design pattern to help readers better understand the design pattern.

I will try to make this example as practical as possible.

It is recommended to read it together with a book listed in the Reference, and then write the code yourself.

Hope this works for you!

## What does each part consist of?

### Brief

Basic introduction of the Design Pattern.

### The Question

What is the requirement? (I will try to make this closer to the real requirement)

### Bad Code Example

Putting aside the perception of patterns in your mind, Think about how you would design?
And a bad code example.

### Good Code Example

Code example using the design pattern.

### Post

A link to my blog post, which contains code explanations and detailed ideas.
